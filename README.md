Conducted a comprehensive project on 'Fire Resistant Beam,' focusing on evaluating rectangular, T-shaped, and L-shaped beam designs to meet the minimum fire resistance criteria of 30 minutes. The project involved an in-depth analysis of beam dimensions following Euro Code and IS Code standards, ensuring compliance with structural safety and fire performance requirements.
